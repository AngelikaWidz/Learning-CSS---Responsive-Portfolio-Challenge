# Learning-CSS---Responsive-Portfolio-Challenge

This is the begining of my journey with learning CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid, which was completely new to me - hence why some files are messed up.

The purpose of this challenge is to experiment with the code, using some starter code so that I get familiar with the structure and understanding what changes what, and to get comfortable with breaking/fixing the code, so that I can write code independently next time.

A portfolio is neccesary for many professionals, especially for me - so I've made a goal for myself to keep adjusting this repo until I can perfect my skills, meaning that it will probably never stop being updated.
